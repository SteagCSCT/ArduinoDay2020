# Digital Clock

In this workhop we will learn how to how to make a digital clock using arduino and RTC module. 


### Objective 

Build a digitalClock using arduino and RTC module, that will keep the time even arduino is turne off . 


### Prototype Building

Here we are using an Arduino as controller and DS323 Real Time Clock module to Count and keep the time and 16x2 LCD Display to Display the Time and Date.
