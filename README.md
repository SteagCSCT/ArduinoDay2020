# Arduino Day 2020
Arduino Day is a worldwide birthday celebration of Arduino. It's a 24 hour-long event – organized directly by the community, or by the Arduino founders – that brings people together to share their experiences and learn more about the open-source platform.

This year Steag Center is organizing Arduino Day 2020 community event at Rajagiri College of Engineering, the program will enable students to do rapid prototyping skills using Arduino and digital fabrication tools.

50 students with 10 Volunteers will doing 7 different hands-on projects at the day. The Steag center will provide the Arduino Kits and Training material and support. 

### Do It Yourself Projects 
* Steag Centre will provide Kit's and Documentation for the projects 
* Students must return all the components and modules after the event. 

## Learn By Doing

We belive learn by doing is one of best learing practise and that's why we created this project page, this page include several projects with complete step by step guide, please feel free to use and modify the code and diagrams.
